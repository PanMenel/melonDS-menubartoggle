These are my forks of melonds adding features I thought should be there already
## 📺 MenuBarToggle Fork
*Implemented a hotkey to hide the Menu Bar.*

I created this because I recently got a vertical grip for my Nintendo Switch, which is perfect for DS games. When streaming melonDS from my PC via Moonlight, the Menu Bar was the last thing cluttering the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> **Full Disclosure:** I am still learning programming. This feature was developed using "vibecoding" (with AI assistance from Grok). While it might not be a 100% professional implementation, it works exactly as intended. Enjoy!

## 🏆 RetroAchievements Implementation
*Bringing RetroAchievements (RA) support to melonDS.*

I saw that the community really wanted RA support, so I decided to take on the challenge. This is a rough, beta implementation that I’ve tested extensively over the last week. I am a huge fan of RetroAchievements and very proud of this progress.

**Important:** This is currently unofficial, so Hardcore mode does not yet provide official Hardcore points.

### ✅ Current Features
* Full backend integration.
* Core frontend implementation.
* Basic connectivity and achievement unlocking.
* Achievements and their info is shown on getting them.
* Basic Login in EmuSettings under new tab.

### 🛠️ Known Issues & Planned Features
<ul>
  <li><b>Leaderboards:</b> Not yet implemented.</li>
  <li><b>Overlay:</b> Missing in-game achievement list.</li>
  <li><b>Progress Indicators:</b> Achievement progress is not currently tracked visually, there is only notification on getting achievement.</li>
  <li><b>Hardcore Approval:</b> Still fixing stuff, so when it will be more than a beta then it could be possible.</li>
  <li><b>Memory Access:</b> VRAM and ARM9 IO memory reading is missing (may affect specific achievements, but i wouldn't worry about that).</li>
  <li><b>Offline Caching:</b> Session recovery works, but the emulator does not cache achievement data to local files yet.</li>
  <li><b>Player Profile:</b> Visible points and profile integration (optional).</li>
</ul>

> [!NOTE]
> **Full Disclosure:** This feature also was developed using "vibecoding" (this time mainly ChatGpt and Gemini). I really put my heart into that implementation, and I hope people will actually think of it as nice thing, so I don't consider my time as wasted.

## How to build
See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for build instructions. this works for menubar fork
> [!NOTE]
> **For RA Implementation** you need to install additional dependencies. Also building may not fully work, but feedback is appreciated

Curl : pacman -S <prefix>-{toolchain,cmake,SDL2,libarchive,enet,zstd,faad2,curl}

## 💜 Support My Work

### 🎮 Twitch
Catch me live on **[My Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/panmenelg)**! I stream my development process and some gameplay. Feel free to drop by, and say hi!

### ☕ Donate
If you find my forks useful and want to support further development, you can buy me a coffee here:
**[There is no better way to thank me for my work ;D](https://ko-fi.com/panmenel)**

Your support helps me keep learning and adding more features!

## How to use

Firmware boot (not direct boot) requires a BIOS/firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite.
DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.

### Possible firmware sizes

 * 128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)
 * 256KB: regular DS firmware
 * 512KB: iQue DS firmware

DS BIOS dumps from a DSi or 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps (in DSi mode) are not compatible. Or maybe they are. I don't know.

As for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!

## TODO LIST

 * better DSi emulation
 * better OpenGL rendering
 * netplay
 * the impossible quest of pixel-perfect 3D graphics
 * support for rendering screens to separate windows
 * emulating some fancy addons
 * other non-core shit (debugger, graphics viewers, etc)

### TODO LIST FOR LATER (low priority)

 * big-endian compatibility (Wii, etc)
 * LCD refresh time (used by some games for blending effects)
 * any feature you can eventually ask for that isn't outright stupid

## Credits

 * Martin for GBAtek, a good piece of documentation
 * Cydrak for the extra 3D GPU research
 * limittox for the icon
 * All of you comrades who have been testing melonDS, reporting issues, suggesting shit, etc
